# Service Broker Library 
## a collection of scripts that make using the SQL Server Service Broker a bit easier.

I first started working with service broker in 2008. Since then I was able to succesfully use it to solve a number of problems and while doing so I was building a set of scripts. The library is the latest incarnation of those scripts.

The code at the moment can be made to work, but it is not straight forward, self explanatory, or redy for generic use. The intention behind this github repository is to start gradually shape it into a truelly reusable tool.

The main objective is to make use of asynchronous, message based processing easily accessible for an average database developer. 

More information about the Sql Server Service Broker can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/sql-server-service-broker).
